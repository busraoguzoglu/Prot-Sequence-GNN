GCN Results:

1- Prot nodes, prot-prot connection. Words as features 1-0 file (same as connecting an edge)

	GCN: 100 epoch 2 layer (512-512) lr = 0.001

	Train Set Metrics of the trained model:
			loss: 0.4555
			binary_accuracy: 0.9622

	Test Set Metrics of the trained model:
			loss: 0.6047
			binary_accuracy: 0.8127

2- Prot nodes, prot-prot connection, word nodes, word-prot connection links with no weight

	Node2Vec via Embedding Vectors: Bad results, around 0.5 ROCAUC
	Metapath2Vec via Embedding Vectors: Bad results, around 0.6 ROCAUC
	
	- These results may need debugging, could be improved maybe

3- Prot nodes, prot-prot connection, word nodes, word-prot connection links with weights (tf-idf)

4- Prot nodes, prot-prot connection, word nodes, word-prot connection links with no weight, links filtered (tf-idf > x)

5- Prot nodes, prot-prot connection. Words as features tf-idf file
